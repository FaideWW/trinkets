# SimulationCraft Trinket Comparison Utility

This tool generates SimC override copies for comparing different pairs of trinkets.

Writing overrides by hand quickly becomes tedious and time-consuming, so I wrote this small utility to help expedite the process.  It can also parse Wowhead URLs to extract item IDs and bonus IDs automatically.
